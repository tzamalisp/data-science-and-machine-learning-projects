# Python Data Science and Machine Learning Tutorials

This repository contains Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning tutorials that I have personally 
implemented and commented in Jupyter Notebook for free. It can be used for educational purposes or as a 
reference guide.

The topics and libraries related to Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep learning that are be presented in these tutorials are the following:
* Jupyter Notebook
   * Notebook documents are documents produced by the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etcâ€¦). Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.
* Data Science:
   * Numpy - scientific computing with Python
   * Pandas - data structures and data analysis tools
   * Matplotlib - data visualization
   * Seaborn - data visualization
   * Pandas built-in functions - data visualization
   * Plotly and Cufflinks - interactive data visaluzation
   * Geographical Plotting with Plotly and Cufflinks - interactive data visaluzation
* Machine Learning
   * Supervised Learning
      * Linear Regression
      * Logistic Regression
      * K-Nearest Neighbors
      * Desicion Trees and Random Forest
      * Support Vector Machines
   * Unsupervised Learning
      * K-Means Clustering
   * Model Evaluation and Bias-Variance Trade-off
   * Principal Component Analysis
* Applied Machine Learning Projects in various fields:
   * Recommendation Systems
   * Natural Language Processing
   * Big Data and Spark tool
      * Apache Spark is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance
* Deep Learning
   * Tensorflow - The core open source library Deep Learning to help you develop and train ML models.
